# About

A small project that came about after wanting to practice JavaScript and HTML5 canvas. I discovered the cellular automaton, Game of Life by John Horton Conway a while back and thought it was a good project for my practicing intentions.

Along the way, it evolved from just being about the ruleset for Game of Life to allowing other life-like cellular automata, through presets and birth/death rule changes in the settings.
